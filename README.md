# Blockchain-Lottery-Smart-Contract-

In this I have created my first and very simple smart Contract on Etherium blockchain using it's language SOLIDITY.

Here any numbers of members can participate in lottery system with minimum fund of 0.04 Ether.

We have one manager and any number of participtants. All members have to transfer minimum 0.03 Ether in our smart contract address and after that all collected fund will get transfer into any one random member account.
